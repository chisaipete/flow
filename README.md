Stitching together all the tools that organize my life to maximize personal capacity and free my mind.

## setup
- Have Python 3.3.* as default version on OS (`python`)
- At base of repository run: `python -m venv venv`

Now all scripts should reference the version of python in that venv, install all additional libs from that path

Sublime Text libraries will need to be installed in the plugin itself, which should only be done when development is complete.  Maybe we can trick sublime with links in the meantime?
